# Port used by data collector.
# Default value is 30002.
#
#pinba_port=30002

# IP address to listen at (leave it empty if you want to listen at any IP).
#
#pinba_address=127.0.0.1

# Defines how often the collector thread has to lock down both request and
# temporary pool in order to process incoming packets and drop outdated ones.
# Default value is 10000 microseconds, i.e. it checks for new data 100 times per second.
#
# Make sure UDP buffer in your system is big enough to store arriving packages.
# Check out netstat -s | grep "receive errors" output - if the number constantly grows,
# then you need to increase the buffer. Linux users can do that using
#   echo "<new value>" > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default

#
pinba_stats_gathering_period=10000

# Defines how old can be data in the request pool. Pinba deletes outdated
# data before processing incoming packets, this setting defines what to
# consider "old". Default value is 900 seconds, i.e. the data will stay
# for 15 minutes (15 * 60 sec), but only if the request pool will not overflow.
#
pinba_stats_history=3600

# Temporary pool size.
# The value should not be too low, or Pinba will start dropping incoming packets.
# Default value is 10000, but in some cases you might want to increase it.
#
pinba_temp_pool_size=10000

# This is basically the number of request records to store.
# If you set the value to, say, 10000, Pinba will be able store 10000 requests
# packets at maximum and newer requests will overwrite the old ones. The rule of
# thumb is to use this formula:
#   <max></max> * <stats_history></stats_history> = <request></request>.
# Default value is 1000000.

pinba_request_pool_size=1000000
